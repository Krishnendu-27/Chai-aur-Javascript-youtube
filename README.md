# ☕ Chai aur JavaScript - YouTube Series Notes & Projects

This repository contains my personal notes, practice code, and mini projects as I follow the **Chai aur JavaScript** series by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://hiteshchoudhary.com/). This series is an excellent deep dive into modern JavaScript fundamentals, advanced concepts, and browser APIs, all explained in a beginner-friendly and practical way.

## 📺 About the Course

The course is part of the **Chai aur Code** YouTube channel by Hitesh Choudhary. It starts from basic syntax and gradually builds up to advanced topics such as closures, prototypes, async JS, and object-oriented programming — including hands-on mini projects.
